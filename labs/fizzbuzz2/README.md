# Lab: Fizz Buzz 2 

## Summary: 

Same as before. Just write some tests. You'll have to create a new project; use 
whatever test framework-- mstest, nunit, whatever. 

###If there's time

Play around with the mutation tester [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/getting-started/). 

The tools should already be set up. To run:
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the directory containing your unit test project.
3. Run this:
```
dotnet stryker
``` 





## Business rules

Surprisingly, lots of professional programmers can't really 
code[1]. FizzBuzz is a classic interview question for sussing-out 
the non-skilled. 
				  
Here it is:
* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* But--
  - For multiples of 3 print “Fizz” (instead of the number). 
  - For multiples of 5 print “Buzz”. 
  - For multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”.

Your output should look like this:
> 1  
> 2  
> fizz  
> 4  
> buzz  
> ...
